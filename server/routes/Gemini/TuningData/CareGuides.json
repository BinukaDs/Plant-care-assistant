      "output": "The Epipremnum aureum, commonly known as the Pothos, is a popular houseplant due to its easy care and adaptability. Here's a guide to help you keep your Pothos thriving. **Light:** Pothos prefer bright, indirect light but can tolerate low light conditions. Avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch the leaves. **Water:** Allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. Overwatering is the most common cause of problems for Pothos. **Temperature:** Pothos thrive in average room temperatures between 65-80°F (18-27°C). Avoid placing them near drafts or cold windows. **Fertilize:** Feed your Pothos with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength during the growing season (spring and summer). You can fertilize every 4-6 weeks. **Additional tips:** Pothos are known for their trailing growth habit. You can train them to climb a moss pole or let them cascade over the edge of a shelf or hanging basket. Regular pruning can help maintain a desired shape and encourage bushier growth."
